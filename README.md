# 202unsold
{EPITECH} | Second year | Math project

Steven is a suit-seller in Mississippi. 
Once a year, he gets rid of his unsold stock, selling separately jackets and trousers, at $10, $20, $30, $40 and $50. He’d like to know how much each piece of clothing is likely to yield (expected value and variance).

Steven gave his statistician friend a mission: to deduce from his past results the probability to sell a $x jacket and $y trousers together. 
It appears that the probability is defined by the following formula (a and b being integers greater than 50, depending on the economic climate)

Let’s call X, Y and Z, respectively, the random variables that represent “the price of a sold jacket”, “the price of sold trousers” and “the price of a sold suit”. 
Given the values of a and b, your software must print:
 - an array summing up the joint law of (X, Y ), and the marginal laws of X and Y ,
 - an array summing up the law of Z,
 - expected values and variances of X, Y and Z.
